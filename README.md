# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
The overview of this analyis was to look at unsupervised machine learning and use it to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrencies. From this we created a report on tradable cryptocurrencies that were grouped by their features accordingly. This report can be used for websites/banks to create an cryptocurrency investment portfolio. 

We used the following approach for this analysis
1. Preprocessing data
2. Reducing Data Dimensions using Principal Component Analysis
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-Means Algorithm
4. Visualized results

## Results 
Below are the results of the graphs from each of the steps in analyzing the data,

 - We see here that the elbow curves from vertical to horizontal at a K value of 4, meaning this will be the amount of clusters used.

 - This 3D scatter of all 3 principal components was obtained by the PCA algorithm that reduced the cryptocurrencies dimensions.

 - This 2D scatted reduced the principal components to 2 from the PCA algorithm. 

## Summary
Overall there were 532 tradable cryptocurrencies and each would have to analyzed to find the best suitable coin to trade to maximize the client's profits. These coins would also have to be analyzed to find potential and attract new clients to invest.
